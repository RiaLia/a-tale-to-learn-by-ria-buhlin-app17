But then, as by a wish,
a young, handsome, tall man slipped on a banana peel and landed in fairy dust.
Granting him magical powers. He then created a beautiful sword to help him on his quest.
His best friend the cheeky monkey Chuck just laughed hysterically.
He was completely unaware of what he just caused by recklessly
throwing his leftovers on the ground.
