There was a grim, ugly, powerful, grumpy old wizard with a mission to rule the land far far away and
finally conquer the world. The Wizard was equipped with the most powerful wand of all the lands.
The wizard was always accompanied by a tiny, brown mouse called Chip.
Chip was actually the younger brother of the wizard.
