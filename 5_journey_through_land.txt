The banana - hero - wizard started his journey through the land by foot.
It was going to be a very long walk, but then he remembered that he's a wizard after all.
So he transformed himself into a great dragon, and flew with his blue glitter wings. Obviously.
Chuck fed him with bananas the whole journey.
